#+TITLE: Plan.cat

I recently found [[https://plan.cat/][https://plan.cat/]], which is an http-enabled fingerd server
online.  It's pretty neat, and has a pretty simple "API" for updating your
plan:

#+begin_src sh
# user=<YOUR PLAN.CAT USERNAME>
T=`mktemp` && curl -so $T https://plan.cat/~$user && $EDITOR $T && \
curl -su $user -F "plan=<$T" https://plan.cat/stdin
#+end_src

This package is a port of that "API" to elisp, basically.

* Configuration

- ~plancat-host~: the server to interface with.
- ~plancat-user~: your user name on ~plancat-host~.
- ~plancat-pass~: your password on ~plancat-host~.
  ~plancat~ also supports using ~auth-sources~, which see.

* Interface

=plan.cat= will fetch your current plan from plan.cat and insert it in a
buffer for you to edit.  Edit to your liking, then call =plancat-send= to
post your new plan.  If you decide not to post, call =plancat-cancel= to
cancel the change of plans.
